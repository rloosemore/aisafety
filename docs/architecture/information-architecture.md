# Information Architecture — AISafety.org

## Design Principle

Every page should answer two questions:
1. **"What's actually happening?"** (honest orientation)
2. **"What can I do about it?"** (action pathways)

The site serves three audiences through three entry points, all converging on community and action.

## Free vs. Premium Boundaries

**Boundary principle:** Free = understanding + basic action. Premium = depth + community + professional tools.

The action pathways are FREE. You do not paywall "how to fight for your livelihood." That would be obscene. Revenue comes from depth, community, and professional leverage.
