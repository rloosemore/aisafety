# Product Directions — AISafety.org

## Direction 1: AI Safety Orientation Engine

**Target users:** Engineers pivoting into AI safety, grad students, policy professionals, educators, journalists covering AI

**Value proposition:** Reduce the time from "interested in AI safety" to "productive contributor" from months to days. The field is fragmented, terminology-heavy, and hard to navigate. This product makes it legible.

**What it includes:**
- Interactive field map (subfields, orgs, debates, methodologies)
- Role-based reading paths (researcher, engineer, policy, educator)
- Saved progress / personalized dashboard
- Weekly signal digest ("what actually matters this week")
- Structured learning tracks
- Decision frameworks for practitioners

**Monetization model:**
- Free: field map, basic reading paths, curated links
- Supporter ($10/mo): deeper summaries, saved orientation, private discussion
- Professional ($35/mo): role-specific toolkits, evaluation templates, teaching packs, policy briefings
- Team ($80/mo): org onboarding packs, team dashboards

**Revenue math:**
- 400 supporters x $10 = $4,000
- 150 professionals x $35 = $5,250
- 15 teams x $80 = $1,200
- Total: ~$10,450/mo

**Risks:**
- Content treadmill if poorly structured
- Perceived as "just another resource list" if execution lacks depth
- Requires consistent curation labor

**Mitigation:** Focus on living, structured documents rather than volume. Build tools that encode understanding.

## Direction 2: AI Safety Professional Toolkit

**Target users:** AI engineers implementing safety practices, compliance officers, startup CTOs, policy analysts

**Value proposition:** Practical tools and frameworks for people whose *job* involves AI safety decisions. Not theory — actionable resources that save time and reduce professional risk.

**What it includes:**
- Safety evaluation checklists and templates
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Regulatory tracking dashboard (EU AI Act, executive orders, etc.)
- Model evaluation templates
- Incident database and pattern analysis
- "AI Safety for [Role]" professional packs

**Monetization model:**
- Free: basic checklists, regulatory overview, blog content
- Professional ($25/mo): full template library, regulatory alerts, evaluation tools
- Enterprise ($75/mo): team access, custom frameworks, priority updates

**Revenue math:**
- 200 professionals x $25 = $5,000
- 70 enterprise x $75 = $5,250
- Total: ~$10,250/mo

**Risks:**
- Regulatory content requires accuracy (liability concern)
- Enterprise sales cycle is slow
- Competing with well-funded GRC tools

**Mitigation:** Start with freely available frameworks, build credibility, then layer professional depth. Partner with domain experts for regulatory content.

## Direction 3: AI Safety Learning Platform

**Target users:** Students, career-changers, professionals needing AI safety literacy, educators

**Value proposition:** The definitive structured learning experience for AI safety — not a MOOC, not a textbook, but an evolving curriculum that stays current.

**What it includes:**
- Structured courses (self-paced)
- Concept explainers with interactive elements
- Reading group infrastructure
- Certification/completion tracking
- Instructor resource packs
- Study group matching

**Monetization model:**
- Free: introductory content, concept explainers, field overview
- Learner ($12/mo): full curriculum access, progress tracking, exercises
- Educator ($40/mo): teaching packs, slide decks, assessment materials
- Institutional: university/org licenses ($500-2000/yr)

**Revenue math:**
- 500 learners x $12 = $6,000
- 50 educators x $40 = $2,000
- 5 institutions x $100/mo avg = $500
- Workshops: 2/mo x $750 = $1,500
- Total: ~$10,000/mo

**Risks:**
- High content creation burden
- Courses go stale quickly in a fast-moving field
- Competition from free university content

**Mitigation:** Focus on synthesis and orientation rather than original research. Living curriculum model. Leverage community contributions.

## Recommendation

**Start with Direction 1 (Orientation Engine)** as the foundation. It:
- Has the lowest content creation burden (curation > creation)
- Naturally leads into Directions 2 and 3
- Creates the trust base needed for premium offerings
- Matches the "clarity + continuity" competitive advantage
- Can launch with a single artifact (field map)

Layer in elements of Direction 2 (professional tools) at month 4-5.
Consider Direction 3 (learning) only after establishing authority.

The sequencing matters: orientation → tools → education mirrors the user journey from confusion → productivity → mastery.
