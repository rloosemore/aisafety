## How Content Feeds Product and Revenue

```
Concept Explainer (free, SEO)
  → reader discovers site
  → reads field map (trust builds)
  → subscribes to newsletter (engagement)
  → receives weekly digest summary
  → wants full digest → considers paying
  → signs up for Supporter tier
  → uses dashboard, saves paths
  → needs professional tools → upgrades

Each content type has a role in the funnel.

4. **Update timestamps** — show when each page was last updated
5. **Correction policy** — publicly commit to fixing errors

### First month:
6. **Org acknowledgment** — reach out to AI safety orgs for fact-checking, credit them
7. **Version history** — show how the field map evolves (builds trust in living documents)
8. **Open research** — publish your research artifacts openly
9. **Revenue transparency** — share how the site is funded from day one

### Ongoing:
10. **Community contributions** — accept and credit expert input
11. **Academic citations** — track who references the site

## Content Differentiation Strategy

**We are not:** another AI safety blog, news site, or course platform.

**We are:** the reference infrastructure for navigating AI safety.

Every piece of content should pass this test:
> "Does this help someone *do something differently* tomorrow?"

If the answer is only "think differently," it belongs in the blog, not the core product.
