## 2. UBI Experiments and Evidence

### Completed Major Pilots

#### Finland (2017-2018)
- **What**: 2,000 unemployed people received ~560 euros/month with no work requirement
- **Results**: Employment rates did not significantly change compared to the control group. However, participants reported substantially less stress, fewer health complaints, more trust in others, and a stronger sense of security.
- **Key insight**: UBI did not solve unemployment directly, but dramatically improved well-being.

#### Stockton, California -- SEED Program (2019-2021)
- **What**: 125 low-income adults received $500/month for two years, unconditionally
- **Results**: Full-time employment increased (recipients used stability to find better jobs rather than juggling multiple part-time positions). Sharp drops in depression and anxiety. Money went primarily to food, utilities, and transportation.
- **Key insight**: Unconditional cash gave people the stability to pursue better employment, not less employment.

#### Germany -- Pilotprojekt Grundeinkommen (2021-2024)
- **What**: 107 participants received 1,200 euros/month for three years (from 2 million+ applicants)
- **Results**: Published April 2025. Participants worked an average of 40 hours per week -- identical to the control group. Showed increased sense of autonomy, better mental health, greater life satisfaction, less stress, better sleep, and more fulfilling social life.
- **Key insight**: Directly debunked the "social hammock" myth -- people did not stop working.

#### OpenResearch / Sam Altman Study (2020-2023)
- **What**: 3,000 participants in Illinois and Texas received $1,000/month for three years
- **Results**: Published July 2024. Spending increased ~$310/month, mostly on rent, food, and transportation. Recipients worked 1.3-1.4 fewer hours per week. Stress and food insecurity reduced significantly in year one but faded by years two and three. Recipients were 14% more likely to pursue education or job training.
- **Key insight**: Cash transfers help with essentials but the well-being effects attenuate over time, suggesting UBI alone is insufficient.

#### India -- SEWA Study (Madhya Pradesh, 2011-2013)
- **What**: Adults received 200 rupees/month (later 300), children received 100 (later 150), in 8 villages for 17 months, compared to 12 control villages
- **Results**: Over 66% used cash for constructive purposes (farm improvement, livestock, better schools). Strong positive effects on nutrition, debt reduction, asset building, sanitation, and drinking water supply.
- **Key insight**: Even very modest cash transfers in developing economies produce substantial quality-of-life improvements.

### Currently Running Experiments

#### Kenya -- GiveDirectly (2017-2029)
- The world's largest and longest UBI study. ~23,000 individuals across 195 villages in Bomet and Siaya counties.
- Tests three approaches: long-term UBI ($22.50/month for 12 years), short-term UBI ($22.50/month for 2 years), and a lump sum ($500 one-time).
- Early findings: No evidence of work disincentives. Substantial effects on occupational choice. Shift from wage employment toward self-employment. Increased happiness and life satisfaction, reduced stress and depression.
- Surprising finding: Lump-sum recipients opened more businesses and earned more from them than even the 12-year monthly payment group.

#### Catalonia, Spain (2024-ongoing)
- 5,000 residents receiving $906/month for adults and $400/month for children
- 2,500 participants randomly selected across Catalonia + 2,500 from lower-income villages
- Payments do not replace existing benefits. Results expected after evaluation period.

#### Marshall Islands -- Enra (Launched November 2025)
- **First nationwide permanent UBI program in the world**
- Every resident Marshallese citizen receives quarterly payments of ~$200 (~$800/year)
- No means test, no work requirement. Includes children.
- Funded through the Compact of Free Association with the United States
- Payments available via conventional channels or a government-backed digital wallet on blockchain
- Expected to cost ~8.1% of GDP

#### Cook County, Illinois (Permanent as of 2025)
- The pilot ($42 million, 3,250 households at $500/month) showed: 75% felt more financially secure, 94% used funds to manage financial emergencies, 70% reported reduced stress
- In November 2025, Cook County approved $7.5 million for a permanent guaranteed income program -- the first county in the US to do so
- New program design expected to be complete in late 2026

### What the Evidence Consistently Shows

Across Finland, Alaska, Germany, Kenya, India, Stockton, and dozens of US city pilots:

1. **People do not quit working.** Most recipients maintain employment. Some reduce hours slightly, often to pursue education, caregiving, or better job searches.
2. **Money goes to essentials.** Rent, food, transportation, and bills -- not frivolous spending.
3. **Mental health improves.** Reduced stress, anxiety, and depression are the most consistent findings across all studies.
4. **Financial stability increases.** Less high-cost debt, better ability to handle emergencies, improved food security.
5. **Employment quality can improve.** People use stability to search for better jobs or start small businesses rather than desperately accepting any available work.
6. **Some effects attenuate over time.** The OpenResearch study found well-being improvements faded by year three, suggesting UBI alone may not be sufficient.

## 3. AI-Specific Basic Income Proposals

### Sam Altman's "American Equity Fund"

In his 2021 essay "Moore's Law for Everything" ([moores.samaltman.com](https://moores.samaltman.com/)):
- **Proposal**: Tax large companies 2.5% of their market value annually (paid in company shares) and tax all privately held land at 2.5% of value (paid in dollars)
- **Projected outcome**: Within 10 years, every American adult receives ~$13,500/year
- **Key argument**: AI will drive costs of goods and services down dramatically, so $13,500 will have far greater purchasing power than it does today
- Altman has described this as "universal basic wealth" rather than universal basic income -- ownership stakes rather than handouts

### Worldcoin / World Network (Tools for Humanity)

- Website: [world.org](https://world.org/)
- Co-founded by Sam Altman. Uses iris-scanning "Orb" devices to create unique human identity verification ("proof of human")
- Vision: Build infrastructure for distributing a global UBI via cryptocurrency, distinguishing humans from AI
- Status: 25 million users as of February 2025. Launched US operations May 2025 in six cities.
- Controversy: Privacy concerns over biometric data collection; regulatory investigations in multiple countries

### Robot Tax / Automation Tax Proposals

- **EU debate (2017)**: European Parliament considered but rejected a robot tax. The proposal suggested companies using robots should pay social security contributions and robots should have "electronic personhood."
- **EU Regulation 2024/1689**: Establishes harmonized rules on AI but does not yet include taxation frameworks
- **Bill Gates**: Publicly advocated for taxing robots at the same rate as the human workers they replace
- **Key challenge**: Defining and measuring "robot income" -- should it be based on wages replaced, cost savings provided, or another metric?
- **Active legislative proposals**: Several "robot tax" proposals were under legislative review in 2025, though implementation details remain highly contested

### The Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act of 2025 (H.R. 5830)

- Introduced by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, October 2025
- Authorizes $495 million annually for fiscal years 2026-2030
- Would select 20,000 participants: 10,000 receive monthly cash equal to fair market rent for a 2-bedroom home in their ZIP code
- Payments would not count as income for federal benefit eligibility
- Status: Referred to House Committee on Ways and Means

### Token Distribution Concept

Altman has floated a concept of measuring global AI output in tokens and distributing a share equally among all humans -- essentially an "AI dividend." While still conceptual, this represents the most direct link between AI productivity and universal distribution.

### Tech Company Profit-Sharing Ideas

- **OpenAI's structure**: OpenAI was originally a nonprofit; its evolving corporate structure has raised questions about how AI profits should be distributed
- **Giving Pledge**: Sam Altman and Oliver Mulherin signed the Giving Pledge, committing to donate the majority of their wealth
- **Broader debate**: Calls for AI companies (not just OpenAI but Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.) to contribute to public funds as AI captures more economic value

## 5. Funding Models

### How Would UBI Be Paid For?

The question of financing is the most common challenge to UBI proposals. Here are the main approaches being discussed and implemented:

### Tax-Based Models

**Income and Corporate Tax Reform**
- Most UBI proposals rely on some combination of income tax, corporate tax, and VAT restructuring
- Economist Thomas Straubhaar describes UBI as fundamentally a tax reform that bundles all social policy into a single instrument
- Challenge: A $1,000/month UBI in the US would cost approximately $3.8-4 trillion/year, roughly 21% of GDP

**Consolidating Existing Programs**
- Eliminating six major programs (EITC, CTC, TANF, SNAP, SSDI, UI) would cover roughly one-quarter of a full UBI's cost
- The remainder would require new revenue or spending cuts
- Advocates argue administrative savings from replacing complex bureaucracies are significant but often underestimated

**Automation / Robot Tax**
- Tax companies based on the labor they automate or replace
- Bill Gates has advocated taxing robots at the rate of the workers they displace
- EU debated in 2017 but rejected; active proposals under review as of 2025
- Challenge: Defining what counts as "automation" and measuring displaced labor

**Land Value Tax**
- Altman's American Equity Fund proposes taxing all privately held land at 2.5% of value
- Proponents argue land is a finite common resource whose value is created by communities, not individual owners
- Historical support from economists Henry George, Milton Friedman, and Joseph Stiglitz

### Asset-Based / Sovereign Wealth Models

**The Alaska Model (Permanent Fund Dividend)**
- Website: [pfd.alaska.gov](https://pfd.alaska.gov/)
- Established 1976. Every Alaska resident receives an annual dividend from oil revenue investments.
- The fund has generated $114.5 billion in total returns since 1977. Current fund value: ~$86.3 billion.
- 2025 dividend: approximately $1,000-1,700 per resident
- Studies show it has reduced poverty, particularly among indigenous Alaskans
- The only functioning universal basic income system currently operating in the US
- Proves the concept works but demonstrates that resource revenue alone produces modest per-person payments

**Common Wealth Models**
- Common Wealth Canada proposes collecting value from land and natural resources to create $241 billion annually, distributed as dividends of up to $7,600 per adult per year
- Similar proposals exist for carbon dividends (tax carbon, distribute revenue equally)

**AI Windfall Tax / Company Equity**
- Altman's proposal: Tax companies with $1B+ annual revenue at 2.5% of market value, paid in company shares deposited into a public fund
- This creates public ownership stakes in AI companies, distributed as dividends
- Projected to yield $13,500/adult/year within a decade as AI companies grow
- Norway's sovereign wealth fund (oil revenue) is cited as a successful precedent for public ownership of resource wealth

### Carbon Dividend

- Tax carbon emissions and distribute 100% of revenue equally to all citizens
- The Climate Leadership Council has proposed this in the US
- Addresses both climate change and income support simultaneously

### Monetary / Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) Approaches

- Some advocates argue UBI could be funded through money creation rather than taxation
- MMT proponents suggest federal governments with sovereign currencies face no inherent financial constraint
- Critics argue this risks inflation, especially if UBI spending exceeds productive capacity

### Key Insight on Funding

No single funding mechanism is sufficient. Most serious proposals combine multiple sources: consolidating existing welfare programs + new taxes on automation/AI/land/carbon + sovereign wealth fund returns. The Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates the concept works at small scale; the challenge is scaling it nationally.

## 6. Criticisms and Honest Assessment

### Serious Critiques

**Cost**
- A meaningful UBI ($1,000/month) for US adults would cost $3.8-4 trillion/year
- This would require roughly doubling federal tax revenue or making deep cuts elsewhere
- Even optimistic funding proposals leave significant gaps
- Reality check: No country has fully implemented a nationwide UBI as of early 2026. The Marshall Islands is the first and it is a small nation with external funding.

**Work Disincentives**
- The Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiments (1970s) found a ~14% decline in labor force participation and 27% reduction in hours worked by women
- The OpenResearch study found recipients worked 1.3-1.4 fewer hours per week
- However: Most modern studies find minimal work reduction. Germany's 2025 results showed zero difference in hours worked. The effect varies significantly by study design and population.

**Targeting Inefficiency**
- Giving the same amount to everyone, including millionaires, is arguably wasteful
- The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues UBI could increase poverty by diverting resources from targeted programs that currently reach the most vulnerable
- Counter-argument: Universality removes stigma, administrative costs, and ensures no one falls through eligibility gaps

**Inflation Risk**
- Injecting trillions in new spending could drive up prices, especially for housing
- If landlords raise rents to capture UBI payments, the benefit is effectively transferred to property owners
- Some studies suggest cash transfers in developing countries can cause local price inflation

**Political Feasibility**
- UBI faces opposition from both left (should invest in services, not cash) and right (too expensive, work disincentives)
- Building political support for breaking the connection between welfare and work requires extraordinary political leadership
- In practice, the US movement has shifted from "universal" basic income to "guaranteed" income targeting low-income populations, which is more politically viable but philosophically different

### What UBI Does NOT Solve

- **Structural inequality**: Cash alone does not address discrimination, educational gaps, or wealth concentration
- **Housing crisis**: Without housing supply increases, UBI may simply raise rents
- **Healthcare**: UBI does not provide healthcare coverage; recipients still need insurance
- **Social isolation and meaning**: Work provides social connection and purpose for many people; cash alone may not fill that void
- **Power dynamics**: UBI does not change who owns the means of production or makes decisions in the workplace
- **Climate change**: UBI is an income policy, not an environmental policy

### Alternatives and Complements

**Federal Job Guarantee**
- Government provides a job to anyone who wants one at a living wage
- Estimated cost: ~$750 billion/year (far less than UBI)
- Provides not just income but also social connection, skills development, and community benefit
- Could coexist with UBI -- the Black freedom movement has historically called for both

**Negative Income Tax**
- Those below a threshold receive a payment; those above pay taxes
- Achieves a similar floor as UBI but costs less since wealthy people receive nothing
- Milton Friedman's original proposal; essentially equivalent to UBI + progressive taxation mathematically

**Expanded Targeted Programs**
- Increase SNAP, housing vouchers, EITC, Medicaid, and other existing programs
- More cost-effective per dollar at reducing poverty among the most vulnerable
- But maintains bureaucratic complexity and eligibility gaps

**Universal Basic Services**
- Instead of cash, guarantee healthcare, education, housing, transportation, and food to all
- Potentially more cost-effective and harder for markets to capture (e.g., public housing vs. rent money)
- Reduces individual choice compared to cash

### An Honest Assessment

The evidence from dozens of pilots is genuinely encouraging: people mostly keep working, spend money on essentials, and experience better mental health. But pilots are fundamentally different from permanent national programs. A pilot gives 125 people $500/month against a backdrop of a functioning economy; a national program giving everyone $1,000/month would reshape the entire economy in ways pilots cannot predict.

The strongest case for UBI is not the current evidence base (which is limited to small-scale, time-limited experiments) but the forward-looking argument about AI displacement. If AI does eliminate tens of millions of jobs -- a possibility many economists take seriously -- then some form of universal income support will become not a luxury but a necessity. The question is whether we build the political infrastructure and evidence base now, before the crisis hits, or scramble to respond after.

The most realistic near-term path is not full UBI but expanding guaranteed income pilots, building on the Cook County model of permanent local programs, and passing federal legislation like H.R. 5830 to generate rigorous evidence at scale. Full nationwide UBI remains a long-term goal that will require either a fundamental shift in political will or an economic crisis that makes it unavoidable.
