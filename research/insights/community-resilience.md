# Community Resilience: Mutual Aid, Grassroots Responses, and Local Action Against AI Displacement

## Overview

When institutions move slowly and policy lags behind technology, communities do not wait. Throughout history, ordinary people have organized, shared resources, built alternatives, and demanded accountability from the bottom up. As AI-driven displacement accelerates, these grassroots responses are not only relevant but essential.

This document maps the landscape of community resilience: real organizations, real movements, and real strategies that people are using right now to protect each other and build alternatives. It is written for anyone who wants to understand what is possible and start something in their own community.

## 1. Mutual Aid and Community Support

### What Mutual Aid Is (and Is Not)

Mutual aid is not charity. It is people helping each other as equals, based on a shared understanding that everyone has something to give and something they need. Mutual aid operates horizontally rather than hierarchically -- no one is in charge or holds power over another. It is built on reciprocity: you help me today, I help you tomorrow, and together we build the resilience that no one can build alone.

The concept has deep roots in communities of color, immigrant communities, and working-class neighborhoods, where people have always organized systems of care outside official channels.

### Lessons from COVID-19: What We Learned

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the largest mutual aid mobilization in modern American history. When millions lost jobs overnight and safety net services were overwhelmed, hundreds of mutual aid groups formed in weeks.

**Bed-Stuy Strong (Brooklyn, New York)** became a model of rapid community response. From March 2020 to June 2021, this Brooklyn mutual aid network supported 28,000 people in Central Brooklyn through a volunteer- and donation-driven grocery delivery program. They raised approximately $1.2 million in grassroots, crowdsourced donations, redistributing it back into the community. Their systems evolved rapidly -- from ad-hoc favors traded over Slack to a robust operation processing 40 requests daily and more than 200 deliveries per week within a single month.

**Key lessons from COVID mutual aid:**

- **Speed matters more than perfection.** Groups that started messy and iterated outperformed those that tried to plan everything in advance.
- **Trust is the infrastructure.** People turned to mutual aid networks because they trusted their neighbors more than overwhelmed government agencies. Negative experiences with official services drove people away; peer-to-peer networks brought them in.
- **Relief and power-building are not mutually exclusive.** Organizers found that immediate help (groceries, rent assistance) built the relationships and trust needed for longer-term collective action.
- **Accessibility beats sophistication.** Word-of-mouth and peer-to-peer outreach worked better than polished digital campaigns.
- **Participation itself is healing.** Research showed that taking part in mutual aid improved participants' sense of control and buffered against helplessness and psychological distress.

### Lessons from the 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 crisis saw communities organize food banks, foreclosure defense networks, and neighborhood support systems. These experiences laid groundwork for the even larger mutual aid mobilization during COVID. The lesson: communities that had existing networks before crisis hit were far better able to respond when it arrived.

### Real Organizations and Resources

- **Mutual Aid Hub** (mutualaidhub.org) -- A directory connecting people to mutual aid networks across the United States
- **American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)** -- Published widely-used guides on creating mutual aid networks
- **Sustainable Economies Law Center** -- Maintains a Mutual Aid Toolkit with legal and organizational resources
- **LA Forward Institute** -- Provides mutual aid guides specifically designed for Los Angeles communities
- **Big Door Brigade** -- Offers resources and training for mutual aid organizing

### Why This Matters for AI Displacement

As AI eliminates jobs, the same dynamics that drove COVID-era mutual aid will recur: sudden income loss, overwhelmed social services, and communities left to fend for themselves. But this time, the disruption will be slower and less visible than a pandemic. That makes proactive mutual aid organizing even more important -- building the networks before the crisis peaks.

## 2. Skills and Transition: Beyond "Learn to Code"

### The Problem with Standard Advice

The standard advice for workers displaced by technology is "learn to code" or "get retrained." This advice is often patronizing, impractical, and ignores the real economics of displacement. A 55-year-old copywriter does not need a Python bootcamp. A graphic designer whose work has been devalued by AI generation tools does not need to become a data scientist.

Genuine economic resilience requires a fundamentally different approach: one that values existing skills, builds on community strengths, and recognizes what AI genuinely cannot do.

### What AI Cannot Replace

Research consistently identifies several categories of work that resist automation:

- **Physical trades in unpredictable environments.** Plumbing, electrical work, HVAC, and other skilled trades require adapting to existing structures, old wiring, unique site conditions -- something robots struggle with fundamentally. A plumber working in a 100-year-old building faces different problems every day.
- **Deep human connection and trust.** Healthcare, counseling, teaching, social work, and caregiving require empathy, split-second judgment, and the ability to hold someone's hand during difficult times. AI can suggest treatment options; it cannot provide genuine human presence.
- **Complex physical environments.** Emergency response, construction, and environmental work involve unpredictable conditions that require human adaptability.
- **Community-embedded knowledge.** Local food systems, small-scale agriculture, artisan trades, and place-based services rely on relationships and local knowledge that cannot be centralized or automated.

### Community-Based Reskilling Models

**Timebanks and Skills Sharing**

Timebanks operate on a simple principle: one hour of your time equals one hour of anyone else's time, regardless of the skill. A lawyer's hour of legal advice is worth the same as an hour of gardening help. This radical equality makes skills-sharing accessible to everyone.

**hOurWorld** (hourworld.org) is the largest international timebank platform, providing free software for communities to set up their own exchanges. Services shared include everything from art classes and language lessons to accounting, computer repair, and childcare.

Timebanks are particularly powerful for AI-displaced workers because they:
- Provide a way to contribute and receive help without money
- Value skills that the market may temporarily undervalue
- Build exactly the kind of community connections that create resilience
- Create economic activity outside traditional employment

**Germany's Transition Model**

Germany provides a proactive model for technology-driven workforce transition. When the coal industry was wound down, workers received support through reskilling programs and assistance finding new employment, helping soften the impact of large-scale industry shifts. The key lesson: transition programs work best when they start before displacement peaks, not after.

### Community Skills Audit

Before reskilling, communities should understand what skills they already have. A community skills audit asks:
- What do people in our community know how to do?
- What services do we currently import from outside the community?
- What needs are going unmet?
- What skills are unlikely to be automated in the next 10-20 years?

This audit becomes the foundation for community-based economic planning that builds on existing strengths rather than starting from scratch.

## 3. Local Economic Alternatives

### Community Land Trusts (CLTs)

Community Land Trusts are nonprofit organizations that acquire and hold land in trust for the benefit of a community. Unlike private ownership, CLTs ensure land is used for permanent affordability and community good -- housing, urban agriculture, commercial space, or community facilities.

CLTs protect against economic shocks by:
- Keeping housing affordable even as neighborhoods change
- Preventing speculative real estate markets from displacing residents
- Ensuring community governance over land use decisions
- Creating stable platforms for local economic development

As AI displaces workers and communities face economic disruption, CLTs provide a foundation of stability: people who cannot lose their homes can take risks, retrain, and rebuild.

### Local and Complementary Currencies

Local currencies are designed to keep money circulating within a community rather than flowing to distant corporations or shareholders.

**BerkShares (Berkshire County, Massachusetts)** is the most successful complementary currency experiment in the United States. Launched in 2006, locals exchange 95 US dollars for 100 BerkShares at local bank branches. Over 10 million BerkShares have been issued, with around 300 businesses accepting the currency. People who use BerkShares make a conscious commitment to buy local and invest in the health of their community.

**The Brixton Pound (London, England)** was launched by the Transition Network to promote local business and reduce carbon emissions. It included an electronic version allowing payment by text message, demonstrating that local currencies can adapt to digital systems.

**The Chiemgauer (Germany)** is another robust example, featuring a built-in "demurrage" (a small fee for holding the currency over time) that encourages spending rather than hoarding, keeping money moving through the local economy.

These currencies matter for AI resilience because they:
- Create economic circuits that are insulated from global disruption
- Incentivize buying from local businesses rather than automated platforms
- Build community identity and solidarity around economic exchange
- Make local economic flows visible and governable

### The Buy Local Movement

The economic case for buying local is substantial: for every dollar spent at a local business, 68 cents stays within the community, compared to just 43 cents for non-local businesses. Communities with active buy-local campaigns saw independent business revenues rise by 7.2 percent, compared to just 2.6 percent in areas without such campaigns.

As AI enables ever-greater economic centralization -- think Amazon, automated warehouses, algorithmic pricing -- buy-local movements become a form of economic self-defense.

### Community-Owned Businesses and Cooperatives

**The Evergreen Cooperatives (Cleveland, Ohio)** represent the most ambitious model of community wealth building in the United States. Launched in 2008, Evergreen connects worker-owned cooperatives to "anchor institutions" -- hospitals, universities, and other large local employers -- that commit to purchasing products and services from the cooperatives.

The Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, and University Hospitals spend over $3 billion annually on goods and services. Evergreen redirects some of that spending to local, worker-owned businesses, creating living-wage jobs for people previously locked out of the job market. Today, Evergreen employs 320 people across multiple cooperative businesses.

**Mondragon Cooperative Corporation (Basque Country, Spain)** is the world's largest federation of worker cooperatives, operating 260 cooperatives in 35 countries with 70,000 employees, 85% of whom are member-owners. Founded after five students pooled savings to buy a failing factory in 1956, Mondragon operates on "one person, one vote," with profits shared democratically and pay capped so the highest-earning worker makes no more than three times the lowest.

Over 60 years, not more than 5% of Mondragon's 120 cooperatives have faced bankruptcy -- a remarkable record given that Spain has endured severe economic crises. Unemployment in the Basque region runs approximately 10% lower than the Spanish national average.

Key cooperatives worth knowing about:
- **Park Slope Food Coop (Brooklyn)** -- Members contribute a few hours monthly in exchange for access to affordable, high-quality food
- **Organic Valley** -- Founded in 1988 by Wisconsin family farmers, now a network of over 1,800 organic farms
- **Ace Hardware** -- A cooperative of independent retailers with $12.5 billion in total revenue, demonstrating that cooperative models work at scale

### The Solidarity Economy

The solidarity economy is a framework for building economic institutions that prioritize human needs and ecological balance over profit maximization. It includes cooperatives, community land trusts, mutual aid, timebanks, credit unions, and other democratic economic institutions.

The **New Economy Coalition** (neweconomy.net) is the main U.S. network, with over 200 member organizations building solidarity economy infrastructure. Their member directory (neweconomy.net/member-directory) is the best starting point for finding organizations in your area.

The **U.S. Solidarity Economy Network** tracks and supports initiatives including worker cooperatives, community land trusts, participatory budgeting, and other experiments in democratic economics.

### Transition Towns

The **Transition Towns movement**, founded by Rob Hopkins in 2005, now spans over 1,400 communities in more than 50 countries. Transition Towns aim to build local resilience by reducing dependence on external systems -- energy, food, economic -- and strengthening community self-sufficiency.

**Totnes, England** (the original Transition Town) has launched projects including a local currency (the Totnes Pound), community energy initiatives, local food systems (Grown in Totnes, Incredible Edible Totnes), an Eco Homes program, and the REconomy Centre focused on local economic development.

The Transition model is directly applicable to AI displacement: communities that have already built local food systems, energy independence, and circular economies are far more resilient to technological disruption.

## 4. Consumer and Citizen Campaigns

### AI Disclosure and Transparency Demands

A growing movement demands that AI use be disclosed whenever it affects people. The EU AI Act and California's SB 942 have made AI labeling mandatory in many contexts. YouTube, Meta, and TikTok have all implemented "Made with AI" tags.

U.S. Senators Brian Schatz and John Kennedy introduced bipartisan legislation requiring clear labels when people are viewing AI-generated content or interacting with AI chatbots.

Research shows that consumers have strong preferences for human-created works and view undisclosed AI authorship as deceptive. This creates leverage for consumer campaigns demanding transparency.

### "Right to Human" Frameworks

While no single campaign has consolidated under the "right to human" banner, the concept is emerging across multiple domains:
- **Right to speak to a human** in customer service (against fully automated systems)
- **Right to human review** of AI decisions affecting employment, housing, or credit
- **Right to know** whether you are interacting with AI or a human
- **Right to human-created content** in education, healthcare, and legal contexts

These individual campaigns could coalesce into a broader movement as AI displaces more human interaction from public life.

### Consumer Labeling and Certification

**Not By AI** (notbyai.fyi), founded in 2023 in Philadelphia, provides free badges for creators to certify that their content is at least 90% human-created. The organization is not anti-AI but advocates for transparency and the preservation of human creativity. Badges are available for websites, blogs, art, films, books, podcasts, and other projects.

This mirrors historical movements for organic food labeling, fair trade certification, and non-GMO labeling -- consumer-driven standards that created market pressure for ethical practices.

### The PauseAI Movement

**PauseAI** is a global grassroots movement founded in Utrecht, Netherlands in May 2023, demanding that governments regulate AI development and pause training of the most powerful AI systems until safety can be assured.

Major protests include:
- February 2024: Demonstrations outside OpenAI headquarters in San Francisco, prompted by OpenAI removing military use restrictions
- May 2024: Simultaneous protests across 13 countries before the AI Seoul Summit
- 2025: The movement's largest protest outside Google DeepMind's London office, responding to alleged failures in AI safety commitments

Notably, most PauseAI participants consider themselves techno-optimists and are often involved in AI development themselves. The movement is not anti-technology but pro-accountability.

## 5. Creative and Cultural Responses

### Artists Organizing Against AI

The creative sector has been among the first and most vocal in organizing against AI displacement, producing some of the most effective grassroots activism of the AI era.

**The #NotMyAI Movement** emerged as a rallying cry for artists whose work was being scraped, replicated, and monetized without consent. Artists organized virtual panels, livestreamed educational content, and linked to petitions. The "Protect Artist Rights from Generative AI" petition on Change.org gathered over 150,000 signatures in under a month.

The movement's core message resonated broadly because it centered on consent, distilled into the phrase: "It's not anti-tech to want to be asked first."

**Technical Resistance Tools:**
- **Glaze** (University of Chicago) makes invisible alterations to artwork that confuse AI models trying to mimic an artist's style
- **Nightshade** is an offensive tool that "poisons" AI training data, causing models to misinterpret images (e.g., seeing a cat as a dog)
- **Kudurru** helps artists detect and block unauthorized AI scraping of their work

These tools face ongoing technical challenges -- a tool called LightShed can reportedly bypass Glaze and Nightshade protections with 99.98% accuracy -- but they represent an important principle: communities can develop their own technical countermeasures.

### The Hollywood Strikes: A Template for Creative Workers

The 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes produced the most significant labor victories against AI to date. Writers struck on May 2, 2023, with actors joining on July 14. The strikes ended in November with historic agreements:

- Only humans can be credited as writers of literary material
- Digital replicas of actors require 48-hour notice, clear consent, and compensation
- AI-generated material cannot be used to undermine writer credits or compensation
- Human workers' contributions are affirmed as necessary to creating goods and services

These contracts set a precedent that extends far beyond Hollywood: the principle that AI should augment human work, not replace it, and that workers have a right to negotiate the terms of AI adoption.

### Storytelling as Resistance

Affected workers are telling their own stories through:
- Social media campaigns documenting real displacement experiences
- Documentary projects capturing community responses
- Oral history projects preserving workers' perspectives
- Art exhibitions exploring the human impact of automation

Storytelling is powerful because it puts human faces on abstract economic trends and builds the emotional connections needed for political action.

## 6. Open Source and Community Technology

### Open Source AI for Communities

The open-source AI movement has grown dramatically. Community-driven models now challenge proprietary systems from OpenAI and Google. Key organizations include:

- **The AI Alliance** (led by IBM and Meta) -- An international coalition supporting open, safe, responsible AI development
- **EleutherAI** -- A grassroots collective of researchers building open-source AI models
- **Hugging Face** -- A platform making AI models accessible to researchers and communities
- **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** -- Defining standards for open-source AI through multi-stakeholder processes

### Community Technology and Digital Justice

**Detroit Community Technology Project (DCTP)**, a project of Allied Media Projects, is the leading example of community-governed technology infrastructure in the United States.

Key programs include:
- **Digital Stewards Program** -- Trains neighborhood leaders to design, deploy, and maintain community wireless networks. Digital stewardship emphasizes self-governance and sustainability, with community members managing their own technology infrastructure.
- **Equitable Internet Initiative** -- A collaborative approach across multiple Detroit neighborhoods to build community-governed Internet Service Providers, redistributing gigabit internet to low-income communities.
- **Data Justice Program** -- Helps communities understand and govern how their data is collected and used.

**Community Tech NY** extends this model to New York City, and similar initiatives exist in cities across the country.

### The AI Commons

The **AI Commons Initiative**, emerging from the Global Coalition for Tech Justice (250 member organizations across 55 countries), advocates for AI as a public good rather than corporate property. Presented at the AI Action Summit in France in February 2025, the initiative argues that AI technologies in sensitive sectors like education and healthcare must prioritize sovereign, public digital infrastructure.

### The Digital Commons Framework

Advocates for the digital commons argue that:
- AI training data (much of it scraped from public sources) should be governed as a common resource
- AI models trained on public data should serve public purposes
- Communities should have governance rights over AI systems that affect them
- Open-source alternatives should be developed and maintained as public infrastructure

Organizations like the **Open Future Foundation**, **Creative Commons**, **Wikimedia Foundation**, and the **Open Knowledge Foundation** are all contributing to this vision.

## 7. Historical Parallels and Lessons

### What the Luddites Actually Wanted

The Luddites are the most misunderstood movement in labor history. They were not anti-technology. They were skilled textile artisans -- people who had spent years learning their craft -- who objected to machines being used in ways that reduced wages and produced inferior goods.

Their actual demands included:
- Machines should produce high-quality goods, not cheap imitations
- Machine operators should be trained and fairly paid
- Productivity gains should be shared with workers, not only enrich owners
- Minimum wages should be established and child labor ended

Unable to legally form trade unions or strike (these were banned under the Combination Acts), Luddites resorted to destroying machines as a form of "collective bargaining by riot," as historian Eric Hobsbawm described it. They also coordinated public demonstrations and wrote letters to industrialists explaining their demands.

**Lesson for today:** The Luddites were right that technology adoption is a political choice, not an inevitability. The question was never "should we use machines?" but "who benefits from machines, and who decides?" The same question applies exactly to AI.

### The Industrial Revolution: What Actually Happened

The Industrial Revolution is often presented as inevitable progress. The reality was decades of immiseration for working people before conditions improved. What ultimately made the difference was not technology itself but the political and social responses to it:

- Trade unions (eventually legalized) fought for and won better wages and conditions
- Factory acts restricted child labor and working hours
- Public education systems were created
- Social safety nets were gradually built

The standard of living for ordinary workers did not rise significantly until roughly 50-80 years after industrialization began. This is not a reassuring precedent for people being displaced by AI today.

### Deindustrialization and the Rust Belt

Beginning in the 1980s, American corporations began offshoring production as NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization accelerated globalization. The social costs were devastating: job losses, home losses, cuts to public services, increases in crime, suicide, drug abuse, and depression.

**What workers tried:**
- In Youngstown and Wheeling, religious and labor leaders organized efforts to buy and operate steel mills as worker-owned enterprises. These efforts were valiant but largely unsuccessful, partly because they came too late and lacked adequate financing.
- Some communities attempted economic diversification, with mixed results.

**What we learned:**
- New jobs often pay less, offer fewer benefits, and are less likely to be unionized
- Communities with higher levels of education fared significantly better
- Early intervention matters enormously -- communities that began diversifying before complete collapse had much better outcomes
- Worker buyouts can work but need institutional support and capital

**Lesson for today:** Deindustrialization shows what happens when communities have no voice in economic transitions. AI displacement is already following the same pattern: productivity gains flowing to owners, costs falling on workers, and communities left to cope alone. The difference is that this time, we have historical knowledge of what works and what does not.

### What Worked Across History

Looking across all these historical parallels, certain patterns emerge:

1. **Collective action outperforms individual adaptation.** Workers who organized collectively -- through unions, cooperatives, mutual aid -- fared better than those who tried to adapt alone.
2. **Building alternatives matters as much as resistance.** The most successful movements both opposed harmful practices and built institutions (cooperatives, mutual aid networks, community organizations) that provided real alternatives.
3. **Early organizing is vastly more effective than reactive organizing.** Communities that began building resilience before crisis peaked were far better positioned than those that waited.
4. **Alliances across sectors strengthen everyone.** The most effective movements connected workers, consumers, community organizations, and sympathetic policymakers.

## 8. How to Start Something Local

### Starting a Mutual Aid Network

Based on guides from the American Friends Service Committee, Shareable, and the Sustainable Economies Law Center:

**Step 1: Find your people (Week 1-2)**
- Start with 5-20 people you already know and trust
- Create a "pod map" -- visualize the people in your life who can provide for basic needs and who you can support in turn
- Check if mutual aid groups already exist in your area (search mutualaidhub.org)

**Step 2: Understand community needs (Week 2-4)**
- Pay attention to local news, community conversations, and neighbor concerns
- Conduct informal needs assessments -- just ask people directly what they need
- Identify specific gaps: food access, transportation, childcare, tech support, financial help

**Step 3: Identify community strengths (Week 2-4)**
- What skills do members have? These could be professional skills, practical abilities, physical items, financial capacity, or simply time
- Every person has something to offer -- the key is making those offers visible and accessible

**Step 4: Set up communication (Week 3-4)**
- Start simple: a group text, Signal group, or email list
- Add structure as needed: shared spreadsheets, request forms, Slack channels
- Maintain one-on-one communication alongside digital tools -- personal connections are more effective than broadcasts

**Step 5: Start helping (Week 4+)**
- Begin with concrete, immediate services: grocery delivery, check-ins for elderly neighbors, childcare swaps, tech help, meal support
- Every pod looks different -- it is shaped by the needs and strengths of its members
- Iterate quickly: what works, do more of; what doesn't, change it

**Step 6: Build for the long term**
- Connect with other mutual aid groups in your area
- Link immediate relief with longer-term organizing and advocacy
- Document what you learn for others

### Organizing Community AI Conversations

Traditional town halls tend to fail because they are "dry and technocratic, leaving little room to explore people's feelings about an issue." Better models include:

**Deliberative processes** involve two-way conversations between community members, experts, and decision-makers where ideas are exchanged collaboratively. The Ostbelgien model in Belgium uses permanent citizens' councils that change every 18 months and initiate citizens' panels throughout the year.

**Practical format for a community AI conversation:**

1. **Start with stories, not statistics.** Ask: "How has AI or automation affected you, your family, or your neighbors?" Let people share real experiences before discussing abstractions.

2. **Map local impacts.** Together, identify which jobs and industries in your community are most affected. Which employers are adopting AI? What changes have people noticed?

3. **Identify shared concerns.** What worries people most? What do they want to protect? What would they like to change?

4. **Explore options together.** What can the community do? What should local government do? What should employers do? What support do people need?

5. **Commit to action.** End every conversation with specific next steps. Who will do what, by when?

### Community AI Impact Assessment Template

Communities can adapt existing frameworks from the National Association of Counties (AI County Compass), the GovAI Coalition, and the Michigan Municipal League to assess how AI is affecting their area:

**Section 1: Economic Impact**
- What industries employ the most people in our community?
- Which of these industries are adopting AI? How quickly?
- What jobs have been eliminated or significantly changed?
- What new jobs (if any) have been created?
- How has income been affected for different groups?

**Section 2: Service Impact**
- Are local government services using AI? Which ones?
- Are AI systems making decisions that affect residents (benefits, policing, hiring)?
- Do residents know when AI is being used in decisions about them?
- Is there a process for people to challenge AI-made decisions?

**Section 3: Community Impact**
- Are people losing jobs? In what sectors?
- Are displaced workers finding new employment? At comparable wages?
- What is happening to local businesses?
- How is housing affordability being affected?
- Are there visible signs of community stress (business closures, population decline)?

**Section 4: Resources and Responses**
- What support services exist for displaced workers?
- Are there local retraining or reskilling programs?
- What mutual aid or community support networks exist?
- What is local government doing in response?
- What are employers doing to support affected workers?

**Section 5: Action Planning**
- What are our community's most urgent needs?
- What can we do ourselves, right now?
- What do we need from local government?
- What do we need from state/federal government?
- Who needs to be at the table who isn't here yet?

## Conclusion: You Can Start Now

The most important insight from all of this research is that you do not need to wait for governments, corporations, or experts to act. Every movement described here started with a small group of people who decided to do something.

- **Bed-Stuy Strong** started with neighbors talking on Slack.
- **BerkShares** started with a few people who wanted to keep money local.
- **Mondragon** started with five students who pooled their savings to buy a failing factory.
- **The Transition Towns movement** started with a teacher giving students a class project.
- **PauseAI** started with one person in the Netherlands who thought someone should say something.

The pattern is always the same: a few people identify a problem, connect with others who share their concern, and start building an alternative. The tools described in this document -- mutual aid networks, timebanks, cooperatives, community currencies, local economic development, citizen campaigns -- are all things that ordinary people can start in their own communities with modest resources and real commitment.

AI displacement is coming. In many communities, it is already here. The question is not whether it will affect your community but whether your community will have the networks, institutions, and solidarity to respond. The time to start building them is now.
