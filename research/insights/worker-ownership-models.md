# Worker-Owned AI, Cooperatives, and Democratic Ownership Models

## Why This Matters

As AI concentrates wealth and power among a shrinking number of corporations, democratic ownership models offer an alternative path -- one where the people who build, maintain, and are affected by AI systems share in their governance and economic returns. This is not just idealism. Cooperatives represent a $3 trillion global economy, and the cooperative model has repeatedly proven it can operate at scale. The question is whether it can move fast enough to matter in the AI era.

This document covers existing models, real examples, actionable steps, and honest assessments of what works and what does not.

## 1. Existing Worker-Owned AI and Tech Cooperatives

### The Current Landscape

There is a small but growing ecosystem of technology worker cooperatives worldwide. The GitHub-maintained tech-coops list (github.com/hng/tech-coops) and the tech-coops.xyz directory catalog dozens of active organizations.

**Notable Tech Worker Cooperatives:**

- **CoLab Cooperative** (US) -- A worker-owned digital agency that builds technology for social impact. CoLab built the Up & Go platform and works with cooperatives, nonprofits, and mission-driven organizations. They demonstrate that a cooperative can deliver professional-grade software development.

- **Loomio** (New Zealand) -- A worker-owned cooperative that builds open-source decision-making software used by cooperatives and governments worldwide. Loomio's own tool is used by thousands of organizations for collaborative governance.

- **Hypha Worker Co-operative** (Toronto) -- A team of technologists, artists, engineers, and designers that collaborates with communities to build better relationships with technology. Founded with seven members, it had grown to ten members and two probationary members by end of 2024.

- **Nilenso** (India) -- India's first employee-owned technology cooperative, building software products and providing consulting services.

- **Igalia** (Spain) -- A worker-owned cooperative with over 100 members that contributes significantly to open-source browsers and web standards. One of the largest and most successful tech cooperatives globally.

- **Comp.coop** (US, founded 2024) -- A new worker-owned tech company explicitly seeking to disrupt the VC model that keeps cooperatives from accessing technology they need.

- **SoberaniaX Federation** (Argentina) -- Established in 2012, created the world's first federation of worker cooperatives in the ICT sector. By 2023, the federation included around 35 tech worker cooperatives encompassing 500-600 workers.

### AI-Specific Cooperative Efforts

Direct AI cooperatives are still rare, but emerging:

- The **Harvard Ash Center** published "Cooperative Paradigms for Artificial Intelligence," identifying cooperative structures at different layers of the AI stack (cloud, data, governance) as promising paths forward. The report notes that nearly every stage in AI model development is controlled by a handful of large technology companies.

- The **Platform Cooperativism Consortium** hosted "Cooperative AI" in 2025, the first global conference on cooperatives and artificial intelligence, timed to the UN International Year of Cooperatives.

- Research on **worker-owned cooperative models for training AI** has explored having data workers earn ownership of the AI systems they help create.

### International Scope

- **UK**: EthiX Coop, founded in 2016, coordinated about 40 tech worker cooperatives with over 200 workers as of 2023.
- **Argentina**: The SoberaniaX federation represents one of the most developed cooperative tech ecosystems globally.
- **India, Spain, New Zealand, Canada, US**: All have active tech cooperative ecosystems, though most remain small.

## 2. Platform Cooperativism

### The Movement

Platform cooperativism was coined by **Trebor Scholz** (The New School, NYC) and **Nathan Schneider** (University of Colorado Boulder) to describe a new kind of online economy: one that combines the heritage of cooperatives with 21st-century technology, free from monopoly, exploitation, and surveillance.

The movement launched publicly in 2015 when over 1,000 people attended the Platform Cooperativism conference at The New School. Their book, *Ours to Hack and to Own* (2016), became a foundational text.

**Core principles:** Worker ownership of digital platforms, decent pay, transparency, co-determined work, and protections for workers.

### The Platform Cooperativism Consortium (PCC)

Based at The New School in New York, the PCC is the movement's institutional hub. It:
- Maintains a directory of platform cooperatives worldwide
- Supports "hundreds of platform co-op businesses with tens of thousands of worker-owners"
- Provides research, education, and advocacy
- Website: platform.coop

### Platform Cooperative Examples

**Stocksy United** (stock photography) -- The most financially successful platform cooperative:
- Founded 2012, publicly launched 2013
- Over 1,800 artists and 60+ staff from 80+ countries
- Revenue reached $10.7 million in 2016, with $4.9 million paid to contributors
- Has paid over $50 million in royalties to artists since inception
- Photographers receive 50% of standard license purchases and 75% of extended licenses (among the highest in the industry)
- Three classes of shareholders: advisors (Class A), staff (Class B), artists (Class C)
- Has paid approximately $1.6 million in surplus dividends to members

**Up & Go** (home cleaning, NYC):
- Launched 2017, connecting worker-owned cleaning cooperatives through a shared booking platform
- Majority immigrant-owned and women-owned, 100% worker-owned
- Workers earn $4-5 more per hour than other cleaning workers in the area
- Only 5 cents of every dollar goes to Up & Go (the platform); the rest goes to workers
- Built by CoLab Cooperative with support from Robin Hood Foundation and Cornell Tech
- Has expanded to Philadelphia and Detroit

**The Drivers Cooperative** (ride-hailing, NYC):
- Founded 2021 with roughly 2,500 drivers
- Grew to over 10,000 signed-up drivers
- Achieved 12x growth to $6.1 million in revenue by 2022
- Drivers earn 8-10% more per trip than on Uber/Lyft
- Secured contracts with the MTA (largest transit agency in North America)
- Expanding to Denver

**Honest Assessment of The Drivers Cooperative:** Some drivers reported the $30/hour guaranteed income was misleading and that the company failed to live up to ambitious goals of workplace equity. This is a recurring pattern -- cooperative startups often overpromise relative to their constrained resources.

**Other Platform Co-ops:**
- **Resonate** -- Music streaming cooperative (one member, one share, one vote)
- **Fairmondo** -- Cooperative online marketplace (Germany)
- **Eva** -- Ride-sharing cooperative (Montreal)
- **Smart** (Belgium/Europe) -- A cooperative for freelancers providing shared services

## 3. Data Cooperatives and Data Unions

### The Intellectual Framework

The idea that data is a form of labor -- and that its extraction without compensation is exploitation -- has gained significant traction.

**Jaron Lanier** argued in *Who Owns the Future?* (2013) that companies monetizing personal data should compensate users through micropayments. In a 2018 Harvard Business Review paper with E. Glen Weyl, Lanier proposed "data dignity" and "mediators of individual data" (MIDs) -- organizations that would collect, manage, and negotiate agreements for user data, including specifying permissible uses and data royalties.

**Andrew Yang** launched the Data Dividend Project in 2020, seeking to establish data-as-property rights under privacy laws like the CCPA, with the goal of mobilizing over one million people.

### Key Concepts

- **Data Cooperative:** A member-owned organization where individuals voluntarily contribute their data, control its usage collectively, and share benefits. Uses "data stewardship" rather than "data ownership" -- the cooperative manages data for collective benefit while members retain fundamental rights.

- **Data Union:** An organizational structure where individuals negotiate collectively for better terms when sharing data with third parties -- analogous to traditional labor unions. Focuses on monetary compensation, privacy protections, and data portability.

- **Data Trust:** A legal framework where appointed trustees manage data on behalf of individuals or groups according to agreed terms.

### Existing Data Cooperatives and Projects

**Health Data:**
- **MIDATA** (Switzerland) -- A cooperative where citizens can store, manage, and control their health data, deciding who can use it for research
- **Salus Coop** (Spain) -- Health data cooperative

**Driver/Worker Data:**
- **Driver's Seat Cooperative** -- A driver worker cooperative using aggregated datasets to champion pro-worker policies

**Data Monetization:**
- **CitizenMe** -- Allows consumers to get paid for data shared with companies; has completed millions of data exchanges
- **Streamr** -- Decentralized data marketplace with cooperative elements
- **Pool** -- Data cooperative for monetizing pooled data

### The Honest Assessment of Data Dividends

Critics, including analysis from the American Action Forum, argue that individual data is worth very little per person (estimates range from $0.20 to $240 per year per person). The Vice headline "Andrew Yang's Data Dividend Isn't Radical, It's Useless" captures skepticism that data dividends alone could meaningfully redistribute wealth. The real power may lie in collective bargaining over data terms rather than individual payouts.

## 4. Community-Owned AI Infrastructure

### Public AI Proposals

A growing movement argues governments should build publicly owned AI infrastructure. A 2025 report from Bertelsmann Stiftung and Open Future lays out the argument for "public AI" -- AI systems developed under transparent governance, public accountability, and equitable access.

**Key proposals include:**
- **Public data centers** that public-sector organizations, researchers, and small businesses can use for training and running models
- **Open training datasets** -- an "open Library of Alexandria" anyone can use
- **Truly open-source foundation models** trained on reliable data with democratic values
- A **"CERN for AI"** -- massive shared computing infrastructure

**Government Initiatives Already Underway:**
- **US National AI Research Resource (NAIRR)** pilot -- providing compute access for researchers
- **European AI Factories** -- EU investment in shared AI compute
- **Canada's Sovereign AI Compute Strategy**
- **India's Open Cloud Compute** initiative

### Municipal AI

Cities are adopting AI at increasing rates (67% of municipal leaders were actively integrating AI into city operations per a 2025 Ernst & Young survey). Some are exploring on-premise, community-accountable AI:

- **On-premise municipal AI** (local LLMs) can operate within city infrastructure, functioning during outages and maintaining data sovereignty
- Cities like Barcelona, Long Beach, Buenos Aires, and Amsterdam are implementing AI for transportation, citizen services, waste collection, and energy management

### Open-Source AI as Democratic Infrastructure

Open-source AI represents a form of community ownership through shared access:

- **Hugging Face** -- Over 250,000 model cards, 5 million+ users, 100,000+ organizations. A for-profit company but built on open-source principles.
- **EleutherAI** -- A non-profit research lab that produced GPT-Neo and other open models, begun on a Discord server in 2020. Demonstrates that volunteer communities can produce competitive AI.
- **BigScience/BLOOM** -- Over 1,000 volunteer researchers from 60 countries created BLOOM, a 176-billion-parameter multilingual model, coordinated by Hugging Face with French government funding.
- **Co-op Cloud** and **Commons Cloud** -- Projects building cooperative cloud computing infrastructure.

### What is Missing

Most "democratic AI" efforts focus on access (open-source models, public compute) rather than governance (who decides what gets built, for whom). True community ownership would require not just shared infrastructure but shared decision-making about AI development priorities.

## 5. Models from Other Sectors

### Mondragon: The Gold Standard

The **Mondragon Corporation** (Basque Country, Spain) is the world's largest cooperative and the seventh-largest business in Spain:
- Over 100 independent cooperatives
- Combined assets of 18.6 billion euros
- Over 70,000 employees in 65 countries
- Has its own university, 15 research centers, and roughly 2,000 researchers
- Teaches approximately 10,000 students

**Key lessons for tech:** Mondragon proves cooperatives can operate at massive scale. But Mondragon took decades to build, had strong cultural and political support in the Basque region, and has faced tensions as it globalized (some international subsidiaries are not cooperatively owned). It also had to create its own bank (Caja Laboral) to solve the capital access problem.

### ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)

ESOPs represent the most widespread form of employee ownership in the US:
- 6,609 plans at 6,411 companies
- 15.1 million participants
- Over $2.1 trillion in assets
- ESOP companies grow 2.3-2.4% faster than expected
- Companies combining ownership with participative management grow 8-11% faster
- Employee retirement assets roughly 3x greater than at non-ESOP firms
- Wages 5-12% higher at ESOP firms

**Relevance to tech:** ESOPs are common in professional, scientific, and technical services. They offer a legally established, well-understood path to employee ownership that does not require full cooperative governance. However, ESOPs give workers ownership stakes but not necessarily democratic control.

### Credit Unions

Credit unions demonstrate that cooperative finance can coexist with sophisticated technology:
- Member-owned financial institutions serving over 130 million Americans
- Have adapted through multiple waves of technological disruption
- Key lesson: Credit unions survived by collaborating through shared service organizations (CUSOs) that let smaller institutions pool resources for technology
- The cooperative model can adapt to disruption, but adaptation requires institutional support structures

### Energy Cooperatives

Rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million Americans in 48 states:
- Formed in the 1930s-40s when for-profit utilities refused to serve rural areas
- Now control critical infrastructure worth billions
- Lesson: cooperatives can fill gaps that profit-driven companies ignore

### Agricultural Cooperatives

Farmer cooperatives generate over $200 billion in revenue annually in the US:
- Land O'Lakes, Ocean Spray, Sunkist, Blue Diamond, and others are household names
- Demonstrate that cooperatives can build powerful brands
- Key challenge: many large agricultural co-ops have drifted from democratic principles as they scaled

### The Pattern

Cooperatives have historically emerged in response to market failures -- when communities need services that profit-driven companies will not provide, or when existing providers are extractive. The AI era may create exactly these conditions: communities needing AI tools that big tech will not customize for them, workers needing bargaining power against automated displacement.

### If You Want to Start a Worker Cooperative

**Step 1: Educate Yourself**
- Read the Democracy at Work Institute's "Steps to Starting a Worker Coop" (institute.coop)
- Attend a Co-op Clinic session through the USFWC (free webinar recordings available)
- Study the TESA Collective's "5 Resources for Starting a Worker Cooperative" (tesacollective.com)

**Step 2: Assemble Your Group**
- You need a core group of committed co-founders (typically 3-7 people minimum)
- All members should understand and commit to cooperative principles
- Define your shared mission and the business opportunity

**Step 3: Choose Your Legal Structure**
- **Cooperative Corporation**: Best for long-term. Preserves cooperative principles in law, qualifies for Subchapter T tax status, allows community investor shares.
- **LLC Operating as Cooperative**: Easier to set up initially but fewer legal protections for cooperative practices.
- **Conversion from Existing Business**: If you already have a business. See the Sustainable Economies Law Center's "Legal Guide to Cooperative Conversions."

**Step 4: Get Professional Help**
- Seek attorneys and consultants who specialize in cooperative law
- The Sustainable Economies Law Center (theselc.org) provides legal resources
- Regional cooperative development centers exist across the US

**Step 5: Write Your Business Plan and Bylaws**
- Standard business plan components plus cooperative-specific governance structure
- Bylaws define membership, voting, profit distribution, and governance

**Step 6: Secure Funding** (see below)

**Step 7: Incorporate and Launch**
- Elect a board of directors
- File articles of incorporation
- Adopt bylaws
- Open for business

### If You Want to Convert an Existing Business

This is increasingly important as 150,000-300,000 baby-boomer-owned businesses become succession candidates annually:

- **Project Equity** (project-equity.org) specializes in cooperative conversions
- The Democracy at Work Institute provides conversion resources
- The process typically involves: business valuation, employee education, structuring the sale to workers, transition planning
- Workers often finance the purchase through internal capital accounts over time

### Funding Sources for Cooperatives

**Non-Extractive Loan Funds:**
- **Seed Commons** -- National network of non-extractive loan funds. Over 422 loans made, investing $101+ million. Terms include no repayments greater than profits, no personal guarantees, no credit scores. Over 12,760 workers benefited, 99% low-income at time of investment. (seedcommons.org)
- **Shared Capital Cooperative** -- A national CDFI loan fund that is itself a cooperative, providing financing across sectors
- **The Working World** -- Non-extractive finance for worker cooperatives

**Cooperative Equity and Accelerators:**
- **Start.coop** -- A co-op equity group and accelerator specifically for cooperative enterprises. Provides funding, mentorship, and resources. (start.coop)
- **Co-op Clinic** (through USFWC) -- Free peer advisory network

**Traditional Sources Adapted for Co-ops:**
- Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)
- SBA loans (cooperatives can qualify)
- Community investment shares (where legal structure allows)
- Crowdfunding (The Drivers Cooperative used Wefunder)

## 7. Challenges and Honest Assessment

### Why Cooperatives Struggle Against VC-Funded Companies

**The Capital Problem:**
Cooperatives are fundamentally undercapitalized relative to VC-backed competitors. A tech startup might raise $10-100 million in a Series A; a cooperative might scrape together $100K-$1M from loan funds. You cannot value a cooperative higher than the sum of its shares, so the standard startup exit strategies (acquisition, IPO) do not apply. This means cooperatives cannot offer investors the exponential returns that attract venture capital.

**The Speed Problem:**
VC-funded companies can blitz-scale: hire aggressively, undercut competitors on price (running at a loss), and dominate markets before cooperatives can build their member base. Platform co-ops must grow organically through genuine community building, which is slower.

**The Talent Problem:**
Top engineers and designers often expect equity packages with upside potential. Cooperatives offer equal ownership shares and stable (often modest) compensation, which can be less attractive to talent accustomed to startup culture.

**The Network Effect Problem:**
Many tech platforms benefit from network effects (more users = more value). Getting the first million users is harder without VC marketing budgets. The Drivers Cooperative competing with Uber is a stark illustration: even with a better deal for drivers, reaching riders is enormously expensive.

### Governance Challenges

**Decision-Making Speed:**
Democratic governance is slower than autocratic management. When a competitor ships a feature in a week, a cooperative might still be debating the approach. This is real, not theoretical.

**Participation Fatigue:**
Not every worker wants to participate in governance. Some want to do their job and go home. Cooperatives must balance democratic ideals with practical operational needs.

**Scale and Democratic Drift:**
As cooperatives grow, maintaining meaningful democratic participation becomes harder. Mondragon's expansion into non-cooperative subsidiaries is a cautionary tale. Many large agricultural cooperatives have become functionally indistinguishable from conventional corporations.

**Conflict Resolution:**
When every worker is an owner, interpersonal conflicts become governance crises. Cooperatives need robust conflict resolution processes, which are expensive and emotionally demanding.

### What is Realistic vs. Aspirational

**Realistic (Achievable in the Near Term):**
- Small-to-medium tech cooperatives serving niche markets (design agencies, consulting firms, specialized software)
- Platform co-ops in local service industries (cleaning, care work, delivery) where community trust matters
- Data cooperatives for specific sectors (health, transportation)
- Cooperative conversions of retiring-owner businesses
- Open-source AI communities that function cooperatively even without formal cooperative structures

**Aspirational (Possible but Facing Major Headwinds):**
- A cooperative competitor to major AI platforms (OpenAI, Google)
- Widespread adoption of data dividends or data-as-labor compensation
- Municipal or public AI infrastructure at meaningful scale
- Cooperative ownership of the AI compute layer

**Likely Unrealistic (Without Major Structural Change):**
- Cooperatives competing head-to-head with VC-funded companies for mass-market consumer platforms
- Voluntary corporate conversion of existing AI giants to cooperative structures
- Data cooperatives generating meaningful per-person income (the math is challenging)

### The Honest Bottom Line

Worker-owned cooperatives and democratic ownership models are not going to replace Big Tech. That is not the right frame. The right frame is: **Can they create viable alternatives that serve communities Big Tech ignores, provide dignified work in sectors being automated, and demonstrate that technology can be governed democratically?**

The evidence says yes -- but only if:
1. **Funding infrastructure improves.** Non-extractive finance (Seed Commons, Shared Capital) needs to scale by orders of magnitude.
2. **Legal frameworks adapt.** Cooperative-friendly legislation, tax benefits, and procurement preferences can level the playing field.
3. **Intercooperation deepens.** Individual cooperatives are weak; networks of cooperatives sharing resources, technology, and knowledge (like Mondragon's ecosystem) are strong.
4. **Expectations are calibrated.** Cooperatives will not produce billionaires. They produce stable livelihoods, community wealth, and democratic workplaces. That is the point.

The UN declaring 2025 the International Year of Cooperatives, Harvard publishing reports on cooperative AI, and the growth of the platform cooperativism movement all suggest the intellectual and institutional groundwork is being laid. Whether it translates to meaningful economic alternatives in the AI era depends on whether the cooperative movement can build at the speed the moment demands.
