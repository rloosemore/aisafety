## 1. Union AI Victories and Precedents

### The Hollywood Strikes: A Blueprint for AI Bargaining

The 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes represent the most high-profile labor actions against AI to date, setting precedents that unions across industries are now building on.

**Writers Guild of America (WGA) -- 2023 Agreement**

The WGA secured landmark AI protections in their 2023 Minimum Basic Agreement with the AMPTP:

- **AI cannot be a writer.** No form of AI may be considered a writer, and AI-generated material cannot be considered "literary material" under the contract.
- **AI output is not "source material."** If a company provides AI-generated content to a writer, that content cannot reduce the writer's compensation or credit.
- **Writers cannot be forced to use AI.** A company cannot require writers to use AI software. Writers may choose to use it with company consent, but this cannot affect their credits or compensation.
- **Disclosure requirements.** Companies must disclose to writers if materials given to them were AI-generated.
- **Training data rights reserved.** The WGA retains the right to assert that exploitation of writers' literary material to train AI systems is not permitted without authorization.

**SAG-AFTRA -- TV/Theatrical Agreement (2023)**

SAG-AFTRA's agreement addressed AI use of performers' likenesses:

- **Digital replica protections.** Creating employment-based digital replicas requires 48 hours notice, "clear and conspicuous" consent from actors, and compensation.
- **Synthetic performers.** Digitally-created assets trained on combinations of human actors are subject to union notification, future bargaining, and potential compensation.
- **Consent and transparency.** Producers must disclose AI use and obtain consent for digital replica creation.

Limitations: Critics noted exemptions for Schedule F performers earning over $80,000, and consent provisions that may apply broadly to future uses with only a "reasonably specific description."

**SAG-AFTRA -- Video Game Strike (2024-2025)**

After an 11-month strike starting July 2024, SAG-AFTRA members ratified the 2025 Interactive Media Agreement by a vote of 95% to 5%:

- Consent and disclosure requirements for AI digital replica use
- Performers can suspend consent for AI-generated new material during strikes
- 15.17% compounded compensation increase upon ratification, plus additional 3% annual increases

**IATSE -- Hollywood Basic Agreement (2024)**

IATSE members ratified their 2024-2027 agreement with 86% approval:

- Any AI use is covered by the union contract
- No member can be forced to enter AI prompts that put another member out of work
- Members who lose jobs due to AI are entitled to severance and retraining
- Regular meetings to discuss AI technology developments established
- 7% first-year minimum wage increase, 4% second year, 3.5% third year

Some members, including the Set Designer's Council, felt AI protections did not go far enough regarding training on creative work.

### Port Workers: A Hard Line on Automation

**International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) -- 2025 Master Contract**

The ILA secured one of the strongest anti-automation contracts in history in their 6-year deal signed March 2025:

- **No fully automated terminals or equipment** (defined as devoid of human interaction)
- **AI, automation, and quantum computing banned** from performing clerical functions
- Semi-automated technology allowed only in exchange for union job guarantees
- Minimum one ILA worker per gantry crane; remote control forbidden for ship-to-shore cranes
- **62% pay increase** for approximately 25,000 workers
- Ratified with nearly 99% approval by 85,000 members at 100 seaports

### Journalism: Contract Protections for the Newsroom

**NewsGuild-CWA -- POLITICO Arbitration Victory (2025)**

An arbitrator found POLITICO violated its collective bargaining agreement by launching AI products without required notice, bargaining, or human oversight:

- The contract requires **60 days notice** before deploying new AI technology that materially impacts job duties
- AI used for newsgathering must meet journalistic ethics standards and involve **human oversight**
- As of late 2025, 43 NewsGuild contracts include AI-related language

**The New Republic** contract specifies generative AI "may be used by bargaining unit employees as a complementary tool in editorial work, but it may not be used as a primary tool for creation," and that AI shall not result in layoffs, fill vacant positions, or reduce pay.

### International Precedents

**Denmark -- Hilfr/3F Agreement (2018, updated 2024)**

The world's first collective agreement for a platform company:

- Minimum pay of 141.21 DKK (approx. 19 EUR) per hour plus welfare supplement
- Sick pay, holiday allowance, and pension contributions guaranteed
- Workers automatically become employees after 100 hours on the platform
- The 2024 Hilfr2 agreement added AI-specific provisions: the employer assumes full responsibility for algorithmic decisions, which can be contested through Denmark's labor dispute resolution system

**Spain -- Sectoral AI Clauses**

Multiple sectoral collective bargaining agreements in Spain now include AI provisions:

- The **banking industry** agreement provides workers the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated variables, and a right to non-discrimination in algorithmic decisions, with human intervention available in cases of discrepancy
- The **credit institutions** agreement requires companies to inform worker representatives about AI systems used in human resources decisions
- The **insurance industry** agreement contains similar AI transparency clauses
- Spain's 2023 Agreement for Employment and Collective Bargaining (CC.OO./UGT) requires AI to follow the "principle of human control" and mandates transparent information about AI in HR procedures

## 2. Active Union Campaigns on AI

### Major Federation Positions

**AFL-CIO -- Workers First Initiative on AI**

Launched October 2025, the first comprehensive labor movement agenda on AI:

- Employers and legislators must advance AI to the benefit of working people
- Workers must be included in design, development, and implementation of AI
- Prevents AI-powered surveillance and unjust layoffs
- Ensures human oversight over employment decisions
- In June 2025, the AFL-CIO and 32 national labor organizations opposed a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would ban states from protecting workers from AI

The AFL-CIO Technology Institute, created in 2021, brings together unions, universities, and think tanks on technology issues.

**TUC (UK) -- Draft AI Bill**

The Trades Union Congress published a comprehensive legislative proposal, the Artificial Intelligence (Employment and Regulation) Bill:

- Risk-based approach similar to the EU AI Act
- Bans reliance on high-risk AI for dismissal decisions
- Restricts emotion recognition technology in workplaces
- Mandates Workplace AI Risk Assessments with 12-monthly reviews
- Employers must publish registers of AI operations
- Workers gain rights to personalized explanations for high-risk AI decisions and human reconsideration

### Sector-Specific Campaigns

**Communications Workers of America (CWA)**

CWA established an AI Committee in 2023 with comprehensive principles for bargaining and policy:

- **Proactive bargaining:** Prioritize AI issues in negotiations; demand transparency from employers
- **Early and meaningful worker voice:** Representation at every stage of AI development and implementation
- Contract language protecting against invasive surveillance, unfair automated decisions, work intensification, and compensation reduction
- CWA's stated goal: "not to stop new technologies but to ensure the benefits are broadly shared"

Sources: [CWA AI Principles](https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-announces-union-principles-artificial-intelligence), [CWA AI Spotlight](https://cwa-union.org/news/spotlight-artificial-intelligence)

**Healthcare -- National Nurses United (NNU)**

NNU has conducted surveys showing AI technology often contradicts nurses' clinical judgment and threatens patient safety:

- AI enables mass surveillance of nurses and other healthcare workers
- Technologies create opportunities for exploitation and scapegoating
- NNU advocates that digital technologies should not replace in-person nursing care

Sources: [NNU AI Page](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/artificial-intelligence), [NNU Survey](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/national-nurses-united-survey-finds-ai-technology-undermines-patient-safety)

**Education -- American Federation of Teachers (AFT)**

The AFT asserts AI's workplace impact is a mandatory subject of bargaining:

- Developing model contract language for AI provisions
- Launched the National Academy for AI Instruction with Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, and UFT -- the first national union/tech company partnership
- The Rockdale 84 district (Illinois) established a joint union-district committee to advise on AI tool adoption and teacher training

**Public Sector -- AFSCME**

AFSCME's 2024 convention resolution on AI commits to:

- Engage, collaborate with, and support other unions working on AI
- Remain vigilant in monitoring AI's impacts on members and the broader workforce
- Develop specific contract language for public sector AI deployment

Sources: [AFSCME AI Resolution](https://www.afscme.org/about/governance/conventions/resolutions-amendments/2024/resolutions/artificial-intelligence)

**Transportation -- Teamsters**

The Teamsters are fighting autonomous vehicle deployment on multiple fronts:

- Calling for a national regulatory standard requiring a human operator in all autonomous vehicles
- Lobbying for AV regulation in California, Nevada, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Texas
- Convinced California legislature to pass bills effectively banning driverless trucks (vetoed by Governor Newsom both times)
- Opposing autonomous trucking companies like Aurora Innovation

### Tech Worker Organizing

**Alphabet Workers Union-CWA (Local 9009)**

- Created the AWU-CWA Committee on Artificial Intelligence in Summer 2024
- Members from various locations, product areas, and employment classifications
- Engages in member-driven campaigns on AI, labor, and policy
- Supported Google Help workers contracted through Accenture who were later laid off after being reassigned to AI work

**Broader Tech Sector**

Since 2020, tech workers have formed unions at Alphabet, Glitch, Kickstarter, Medium, the New York Times, and the Washington Post (spring 2025). National unions CWA, OPEIU, and Teamsters have all launched coordinated efforts to organize the tech sector.

## 3. Collective Bargaining Strategies

### What AI Protections Can Be Negotiated

Based on analysis of 175+ collective bargaining agreements by the UC Berkeley Labor Center and other research, unions can negotiate the following types of AI protections:

#### Advance Notice and Consultation
- **60-day bargaining windows** before new AI deployment (POLITICO/NewsGuild model)
- **6-month advance notice** for AI changes affecting wages, hours, or conditions (Washington state OFM directive)
- **Joint technology committees** with union representation to review and advise on AI adoption
- Mandatory disclosure of what AI systems are being used and what data trains them

#### Job Security and Anti-Displacement
- **No-layoff clauses** tied to AI deployment (New Republic/NewsGuild model)
- **Bans on full automation** of specific functions (ILA model)
- AI cannot be used to fill vacant positions or reduce headcount
- Severance and retraining packages triggered by AI-related job loss (IATSE model)
- Attrition-only provisions -- positions eliminated by AI may only be reduced through natural attrition

#### Human Oversight and Decision-Making
- **No automated decisions** that produce detriment without human review (Unite the Union model)
- Workers' right to human intervention in algorithmic decisions (Spain banking model)
- AI must be a complementary tool, not a primary tool for core work
- Human oversight required for AI used in core functions (NewsGuild journalism model)

#### Training and Retraining
- Joint education and training funds for AI skills development
- Employer-funded retraining when AI changes job functions
- Inclusive training practices ensuring access for all workers
- Training on how AI systems work and how to use them safely

#### Worker Data Protections
- Workers' right to know about, access, correct, and delete data gathered about them
- Restrictions on AI-powered surveillance and monitoring
- Requirements for algorithmic transparency -- how systems make decisions affecting workers
- Ban on emotion recognition technology in workplaces

#### Compensation and Benefit Protections
- AI cannot be used to reduce compensation or benefit levels
- Profit-sharing or compensation increases tied to productivity gains from AI
- Minimum compensation floors maintained regardless of AI adoption
- Training time compensated as work time

### Template and Model Contract Language

Several organizations have published model contract language that unions can adapt:

1. **Penn State School of Labor and Employment Relations** -- Model Collective Bargaining Language on AI in Healthcare Contracts, including provisions for joint training funds, advance notice of AI surveillance, early retirement/severance for displacement, and technology governance committees.
   Source: [Penn State LER](https://ler.la.psu.edu/labor-school/model-collective-bargaining-language-on-ai-in-healthcare-contracts/)

2. **Unite the Union (UK)** -- AI Model Agreement for officers and representatives, covering human contact requirements, no automated detrimental decisions, and union agreement required before AI introduction.

### "Just Transition" Models for AI Displacement

Drawing on climate transition frameworks, unions are applying "just transition" principles to AI:

- **Redeployment first:** Workers displaced by AI should be redeployed to comparable positions before any layoffs
- **Training and reskilling:** Dedicated funds and programs to help workers transition to new roles, with training time compensated
- **Graduated severance:** When redeployment is not feasible, structured severance scaled by years of service (typically one week to one month per year of service), continued health coverage, and early retirement options
- **Advance planning:** Technology committees that identify potential displacements early and develop transition plans before displacement occurs
- **Community investment:** Some agreements require employer contributions to community development funds when automation displaces workers in concentrated areas

---

## 4. Non-Union Collective Action

### Worker Advocacy Outside Traditional Unions

**Tech Worker Organizing**

- **No Tech for Apartheid** -- grassroots campaign by tech workers opposing technology contracts with military and surveillance applications
- **Tech Workers Coalition** -- cross-company organizing body for tech industry workers concerned about the social impact of their work
- **Game Workers Unite / United Videogame Workers** -- industry-wide video game union launched to address labor issues including AI
- **Coworker.org** -- platform enabling workers to launch campaigns at their workplaces without formal union structures

**Gig and Platform Workers**

- **Data Labelers Association (Kenya)** -- organized by AI data labelers and content moderators fighting for fair pay and working conditions. In early 2024, nearly 100 Kenyan data workers wrote an open letter to the US President describing conditions as exploitative
- Bihar, India passed the **Bihar Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration, Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2025** after coordinated mobilization by UNI-affiliated unions

### Professional Associations

Professional bodies are also taking positions on AI that overlap with worker protection:

- **IATSE** released Core Principles for AI/ML in entertainment (2023), emphasizing that fruits of increased productivity must be "shared equitably among all stakeholders"
- **AFT** launched systematic AI education partnerships with major AI companies
- **American Medical Association (AMA)** has published positions on AI in healthcare decision-making
- **IEEE** has developed Ethically Aligned Design frameworks that include worker impact considerations

### Consumer and Public Pressure

Consumer demand for human interaction is creating natural allies for workers:

- Surveys show 71% of Gen Z consumers prefer reaching a human for customer service
- Public backlash against AI-generated content in media and entertainment has supported worker positions
- Consumer campaigns have pressured companies to maintain human customer service options

---

## 5. Regulatory and Legislative Campaigns

### Worker-Backed Legislation

**Washington State -- SB 5422 (Bateman Bill, 2025)**

Would make AI adoption a mandatory bargaining subject for public sector employees when it affects hours, wages, or working conditions:

- Requires public employers to bargain before implementing AI that impacts employment conditions
- Supported by Teamsters 117 and Washington Public Employees Association
- Washington's Office of Financial Management already requires 6 months notice to union-represented state employees for generative AI changes

**New York State -- LOADinG Act (2024)**

Requires oversight of AI use by state agencies, ensuring AI is used appropriately and protecting state workers from irresponsible AI use.

**New York City -- Local Law 144**

Requires automated hiring tools to undergo bias audits before use, establishing a model for regulating AI in employment decisions.

**California**

- **Workplace Technology Accountability Act (2022)** -- framework for regulating employer use of electronic monitoring and automated decision systems
- **Bossware and Oppressive Technologies Act (New York, 2024)** -- broad framework for regulating surveillance and automated systems, requiring impact assessments
- Multiple bills to regulate autonomous trucks passed the legislature but were vetoed by Governor Newsom

**Colorado AI Act**

Requires deployers of high-risk AI systems to:
- Use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination
- Conduct impact assessments
- Provide transparency disclosures to consumers
- Document AI decision-making processes

**Illinois**

Requires employers to notify candidates when AI analyzes video interviews and obtain consent before AI-based evaluation.

### Federal Developments

- Senator Klobuchar's **Artificial Intelligence Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act** proposed enforceable testing standards for high-risk AI systems and transparency reporting requirements
- The AFL-CIO and 32 labor organizations opposed provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would preempt state AI worker protection laws
- More than **1,000 AI-related bills** were introduced across nearly every U.S. state in 2024-2025

## 6. International Comparison

### European Union

**EU AI Act (Effective August 1, 2024)**

The world's first comprehensive AI regulation:

- **Prohibited practices** (effective February 2, 2025): Bans emotion recognition in workplaces and biometric categorization
- **High-risk classification** for AI tools used in employment decisions, worker management, education, and credit scoring
- **AI literacy requirements** for both providers and deployers of AI systems
- **Fines up to 35 million EUR or 7% of global annual turnover** for violations
- Phased implementation through 2027 for different risk categories

**European Works Councils**

EU-level information and consultation bodies that give workers a voice in multinational companies' technology decisions. Under existing EU directives, works councils must be consulted on matters affecting employment, work organization, and working conditions -- including AI deployment.

### Nordic Model

The Nordic countries demonstrate the most advanced tripartite approach to AI governance:

- **High digitalization rates:** Denmark leads with 24% of companies using AI, followed by Sweden at 16%
- **Tripartite negotiation:** Government, employer associations, and unions negotiate jointly on AI policy
- **Pioneer agreements:** Denmark (Hilfr/3F), Sweden, and Norway have developed platform economy collective agreements
- **Values framework:** Rights-based ethics and ethics of care are the most prominent framings, prioritizing transparency, fairness, and collective wellbeing
- Union density remains high (60-90%+ in Nordic countries), ensuring broad worker representation in AI decisions

### Developing World

**Key challenges:**

- AI data labeling workers in Kenya, Philippines, India, and other countries face exploitative conditions -- in early 2024, nearly 100 Kenyan data labelers wrote an open letter describing conditions as exploitative
- The **Data Labelers Association** in Kenya represents one of the first organizing efforts among AI data workers globally
- Workers in AI supply chains often lack basic labor protections, with unclear business process outsourcing practices limiting organizing capacity
- In Turkey, content moderators alleged they were fired for attempting to unionize

**Emerging responses:**

- Bihar, India's 2025 gig worker protection bill provides a model for platform and AI worker protections in the Global South
- ILO research is documenting the "AI divide" and advocating for protections in lower-income countries
- Growing awareness of "AI colonialism" -- the extraction of labor and environmental resources from the Global South to build AI systems for the Global North

## 7. How to Get Involved

### If You Want to Join or Form a Union

**Step 1: Find Your Union**

Identify which union represents workers in your sector:

| Video Games | United Videogame Workers, CWA | [cwa-union.org](https://cwa-union.org) |

**Step 2: Start Organizing in a Non-Union Workplace**

Based on NLRB guidance and labor organizing best practices:

1. **Talk to coworkers** about shared concerns, especially around AI and technology in the workplace. Build support through one-on-one conversations.
2. **Form an organizing committee** of trusted coworkers representing different departments and shifts.
3. **Gather authorization cards/petitions** -- you need at least 30% of workers to sign to file for an NLRB election, though a strong majority (65%+) is recommended before filing.
4. **Contact a union organizer** from a relevant union for guidance and support.
5. **Two paths to recognition:**
   - Ask your employer for **voluntary recognition** (requires majority support evidence)
   - File a **petition with the NLRB** for a formal election
6. **Once recognized, negotiate** your first contract, including AI-specific protections.

**Step 3: If You Are Already in a Union -- Push for AI Protections**

1. **Raise AI as a bargaining priority** with your shop steward, bargaining committee, or union leadership.
2. **Document how AI is being used** in your workplace -- what systems, what data, what decisions they affect.
3. **Propose specific contract language** using the model language resources listed in Section 3.
4. **Request information from your employer** about AI systems under existing information rights.
5. **Build a coalition** with coworkers who share concerns about AI's impact on your work.

### Template: Key AI Contract Provisions to Negotiate

Use this as a starting checklist when preparing to bargain over AI:

**Advance Notice and Consultation**
- [ ] Require X days/months advance notice before AI deployment affecting job duties
- [ ] Establish a joint labor-management AI/technology committee
- [ ] Mandate employer disclosure of all AI systems used and data collected

**Job Security**
- [ ] AI shall not be used to eliminate positions, reduce headcount, or fill vacancies
- [ ] Displaced workers to be offered comparable positions or retraining first
- [ ] Severance provisions triggered by AI-related job loss

**Human Oversight**
- [ ] No employment decisions (hiring, discipline, termination, promotion, pay) made solely by AI
- [ ] Workers have the right to request human review of algorithmic decisions
- [ ] AI used as a complementary tool, not a replacement for core job functions

**Worker Data Protections**
- [ ] Workers' right to know what data is collected about them and how it is used
- [ ] Right to access, correct, and delete personal data used by AI systems
- [ ] Restrictions on AI-powered surveillance, monitoring, and emotion recognition

**Training and Transition**
- [ ] Employer-funded training on AI tools and their workplace impact
- [ ] Reskilling programs for workers whose roles change due to AI
- [ ] Training time compensated as working time

**Compensation**
- [ ] AI productivity gains shared with workers through compensation increases
- [ ] No reduction in pay, benefits, or working conditions due to AI adoption
- [ ] Regular wage reviews accounting for AI's impact on workload and productivity

## Key Takeaways

1. **Collective bargaining works.** Unions are winning real AI protections -- from the WGA's authorship rules to the ILA's automation ban to the NewsGuild's 60-day bargaining windows. These are enforceable rights, not voluntary guidelines.

2. **The window for action is now.** As AI deployment accelerates, the terms being set today will shape workplace AI governance for years. The unions winning the strongest protections are those that organized and bargained before AI was deployed, not after.

3. **Model language exists.** You do not need to start from scratch. Penn State, Unite the Union, the UC Berkeley Labor Center, and others have published model contract provisions that can be adapted to any sector.

4. **International examples point the way.** From Denmark's platform agreements to Spain's sectoral AI clauses to the Nordic tripartite model, there are proven frameworks for ensuring workers have a voice in AI governance.

5. **Union and non-union workers can act.** Whether through formal collective bargaining, worker advocacy groups, professional associations, or legislative campaigns, there are multiple paths to securing AI protections.

6. **The fight is cross-sector.** Entertainment, healthcare, education, logistics, journalism, public sector, tech -- every industry is facing AI disruption. Cross-sector solidarity and shared strategies strengthen all workers' positions.

7. **42% of European unions are already bargaining on AI.** According to UNI Europa research, this is not a future concern -- it is happening now. Workers who are not yet organizing around AI risk being left behind.
