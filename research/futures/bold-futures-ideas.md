# Bold Ideas for AI-Positive Futures

> Brainstorm artifact: 20 concrete mechanisms for getting from "AI is displacing workers and concentrating wealth" to a genuinely good future. Each must pass the "helpless individual" test — a regular person can see themselves participating AND believe it could actually work.

---

## 1. The Compute Dividend

**Mechanism:** AI runs on compute. Compute is a finite, measurable resource. A national Compute Dividend Fund taxes every GPU-hour used for commercial AI inference and pays every citizen a quarterly dividend — like Alaska's Permanent Fund, but for the AI age. The fund grows as AI usage grows, so the more AI automates, the more everyone gets paid.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Alaska has done this with oil for 40+ years. You can call your representative today and say "I want an AI Compute Dividend" and point to the Alaska model. It's not utopian — it's a policy with a zip code.

---

## 2. Neighborhood AI Guilds

**Mechanism:** Small groups (5-30 people) in a neighborhood pool money monthly ($20-50/person) to collectively subscribe to, configure, and run AI tools for local needs — a bookkeeper bot for local businesses, a grant-writing assistant for the church, a tutoring system for kids. The guild owns the configuration and the data. Members build AI literacy by using the tools together, not by taking a course.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** You could start one next Tuesday with five neighbors and a group chat. No permission needed, no policy change required. It's a book club, but for AI tools that save everyone money.

---

## 3. The Right to Your Own Replacement

**Mechanism:** When a company uses AI to automate a job, the displaced worker gets legal ownership of a percentage of the AI system's output value for 5 years — essentially, you earn royalties on your own replacement. Your expertise trained the system (directly or indirectly), and the law recognizes that contribution. Companies can still automate, but they can't zero out the people who built the knowledge the AI encodes.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** This follows the logic of severance pay, IP rights, and transition benefits. You can lobby for it at the state level. It makes automation expensive enough to be gradual and fair enough to be tolerable.

---

## 4. Municipal AI Utilities

**Mechanism:** Cities create publicly-owned AI utilities — like the power company or water authority, but for AI services. The city runs its own inference infrastructure, offers AI tools to residents and local businesses at cost, and keeps the data local. Revenue from commercial use funds city services. Think "city broadband" but for AI compute.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Over 750 U.S. communities already run their own broadband or electric utilities. This is the same playbook. You can show up at a city council meeting and propose it.

---

## 5. The 1,000-Hour Transition Guarantee

**Mechanism:** Every worker whose role is substantially automated gets 1,000 hours of paid transition support — not retraining in the abstract, but a personal advisor, living stipend, skill assessment, and three concrete pathways to new work. Funded by a small automation levy on companies that reduce headcount by more than 20% using AI in a single year. The guarantee is a floor, not a ceiling.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Germany's Kurzarbeit (short-time work) program saved millions of jobs during COVID. This borrows from that playbook but adapts it for permanent displacement. You can campaign for it at the state level.

---

## 6. Data Cooperatives ("Your Data, Your Union")

**Mechanism:** People form cooperatives that collectively bargain with AI companies over the use of their data. Instead of clicking "I agree" individually, the co-op negotiates on behalf of thousands. If a company wants your health data, your driving data, your creative output — they negotiate with the co-op. The co-op extracts revenue and distributes it. Like a union, but for your digital labor.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Agricultural co-ops have worked this way for a century. The EU's GDPR already established the principle that your data is yours. You join a data co-op the same way you'd join a credit union — sign up, pay a small fee, and suddenly you have collective power.

---

## 7. Automation Impact Scores (Public Shaming That Works)

**Mechanism:** A public, standardized "Automation Impact Score" for every major company — how many jobs they've automated, whether displaced workers got transition support, how much profit went to shareholders vs. workers. Published annually like environmental impact reports. Companies with bad scores face consumer pressure, investor skepticism, and regulatory scrutiny. Good scores become a competitive advantage.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** ESG scores and carbon disclosure already work this way. Consumers can check the score before buying. Investors can screen portfolios. It turns corporate behavior into a public scorecard.

---

## 8. AI Apprenticeships (The Human-AI Team Model)

**Mechanism:** Instead of "AI replaces worker," mandate a transition period where AI systems work alongside existing employees who become AI supervisors, trainers, and quality controllers. The worker doesn't lose their job — their job evolves into managing and improving the AI that does their old tasks. Legally protected transition period of 2 years minimum.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** The skilled trades already work this way — apprentice, journeyman, master. You're not replaced by the power drill; you become the person who uses the power drill. This reframes automation as a promotion, not a firing.

---

## 9. The Displacement Insurance Pool

**Mechanism:** A new form of insurance — like unemployment insurance, but specifically for AI displacement. Workers and employers both contribute. When your job is automated, the insurance pays 80% of your salary for 18 months while you transition AND funds your retraining. Unlike unemployment, it's designed for the specific shape of AI displacement: sudden, potentially permanent, requiring significant reskilling.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** We already have unemployment insurance, FDIC deposit insurance, flood insurance. This is a new category of insurance for a new category of risk. Your state legislature can create it.

---

## 10. Community Wealth Trusts

**Mechanism:** A community (town, county, neighborhood) creates a trust that owns shares in AI companies and local AI-enabled businesses. The trust is governed by elected local residents. Dividends flow into community services — schools, parks, senior care, small business grants. Like a community land trust, but for AI-era wealth.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Community land trusts already exist in hundreds of U.S. cities. Sovereign wealth funds (Norway, Alaska, Singapore) prove the model at national scale. This brings it to the local level where you can actually participate in governance.

---

## 11. The AI Licensing Exam

**Mechanism:** Before deploying AI that replaces human workers in high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, education, finance, transportation), companies must pass a public licensing exam — just like doctors, lawyers, and electricians. The exam covers safety, bias, transition plans for affected workers, and ongoing monitoring. Unlicensed AI deployment in regulated domains is illegal.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** We already require licensing for hundreds of professions. Extending this to AI systems that do the same work is intuitive and enforceable. You can lobby your state licensing board today.

---

## 12. Open-Source AI Commons

**Mechanism:** Publicly-funded AI models released as genuine public goods — no corporate lock-in, no subscription fees, no data harvesting. Funded by a small tax on commercial AI revenue (1-2%). Governed by an independent foundation modeled on public media (like the BBC or PBS, but for AI). Anyone can use the models; small businesses and individuals get access to the same AI capabilities as Fortune 500 companies.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Linux, Wikipedia, and public broadcasting already prove this model. The technology exists. The funding mechanism exists. You're supporting a specific policy proposal, not a fantasy.

---

## 13. Time Banking 2.0 (The Human Skills Exchange)

**Mechanism:** As AI handles more knowledge work, human skills that AI can't replicate — caregiving, mentorship, emotional support, hands-on craft, community organizing — become the new valuable currency. Time banks formalize this: one hour of your human skill earns one time credit, redeemable for an hour of someone else's human skill. AI handles the matching and coordination. The things machines can't do become the economy's most valued resource.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Time banks already exist in over 30 countries. Adding AI-powered matching makes them 10x more useful. You can join or start one this month. It's a parallel economy that values what makes you human.

---

## 14. The Automation Tax Rebate

**Mechanism:** Flip the automation tax on its head: instead of taxing automation to slow it down, give companies a generous tax rebate for every displaced worker they successfully transition to a new role (internal or external) within 12 months. Make it more profitable to transition workers than to dump them. Track outcomes — the worker must actually be employed and earning at or above their previous salary.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Tax incentives for hiring (like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit) already exist. This extends the same logic to transitions. It aligns corporate incentives with worker welfare without banning automation.

---

## 15. Citizen AI Assemblies

**Mechanism:** Randomly selected citizens (like jury duty) convene to make binding recommendations about how AI is deployed in their community. Should the school district use AI grading? Should the hospital use AI diagnostics? Should the city use AI for policing? The assembly hears from experts, deliberates, and issues a decision that local government must follow or publicly explain why not.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Ireland used citizens' assemblies to resolve its most divisive issues (abortion, same-sex marriage). France used one for climate policy. This applies proven democratic innovation to AI governance. You could be randomly selected to serve — that's real power.

---

## 16. The "Made by Humans" Premium

**Mechanism:** Create a credible, auditable certification mark — like "organic" or "fair trade" — for products and services produced primarily by human labor. Consumers who value human work can choose it. Businesses that maintain human workforces can charge a premium. The certification body is independent and rigorous. Over time, "Made by Humans" becomes a brand that people trust and seek out.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Fair Trade coffee proved that millions of consumers will pay more for ethical production. "Made by Humans" taps the same instinct. You vote with your wallet every time you buy.

---

## 17. Universal Transition Accounts

**Mechanism:** Every working adult gets a government-backed Transition Account — like a 401(k), but specifically for career changes. Employers contribute, government matches, and the funds can only be used for education, training, living expenses during career transitions, or starting a small business. The account follows you your entire career. When AI disrupts your field, you're not starting from zero.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Singapore's SkillsFuture program gives every citizen over 25 a credit for training. This goes further by creating a full transition safety net. You can campaign for it as a concrete policy proposal.

---

## 18. AI Profit-Sharing Mandates

**Mechanism:** When a company's profit margin increases by more than a threshold (say, 15%) due to AI automation in a single year, a percentage of the excess profit (say, 30%) must be distributed to current and recently-displaced employees. Not optional, not a "program" — a mandate, like minimum wage. The mechanism is simple: if AI makes your company dramatically more profitable, the people who built that company share in the gains.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** Profit-sharing mandates already exist in Mexico (10% of profits to workers, in law since 1917) and France (mandatory in companies over 50 employees). This isn't radical — it's applying existing models to a new situation.

---

## 19. Sanctuary Sectors

**Mechanism:** Democratically designate certain sectors where AI cannot fully replace human labor — education (real teachers), healthcare (real nurses), eldercare (real caregivers), justice (real judges), childcare (real humans). AI can assist in these sectors, but a human must be the primary provider. This isn't anti-technology; it's a society deciding that some relationships are too important to automate. These sectors become massive employers.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** We already do this. We require human pilots on commercial flights even though autopilot exists. We require human pharmacists even though robots can fill prescriptions. This extends the same principle. You can campaign for specific sectors to receive sanctuary status.

---

## 20. The Worker Transition Corps

**Mechanism:** A national service program — like AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, but specifically for the AI transition. Displaced workers join the Corps and spend 6-12 months helping their communities adapt to AI: teaching digital literacy to seniors, helping small businesses adopt AI tools, serving as community AI advocates. They get a living stipend, health insurance, training, and a path to permanent employment. The Corps creates meaningful work during the transition while building community resilience.

**Why it's believable/actionable:** AmeriCorps already places 75,000 people a year. The Civilian Conservation Corps employed 3 million during the Great Depression. This is the same proven model, adapted for the AI age. You could sign up or advocate for its creation.

---

## Bonus Ideas (Shorter Form)

### 21. AI Whistleblower Protections
Legal protections for employees who report unsafe or workforce-destructive AI deployments. Like financial whistleblower protections, but for AI. Includes bounties for reporting companies that automate without required transition support.

### 22. The Neighborhood Robot Tax
Hyperlocal: any business using AI/robots in a specific commercial district pays a small monthly fee into a neighborhood fund. The fund is spent by neighborhood vote. Keeps the benefits of automation circulating locally.

### 23. Portable Benefits Backpack
Decouple benefits (health insurance, retirement, disability) from employment entirely. Every person carries their own "benefits backpack" funded by a combination of individual, employer, and government contributions. When AI kills your job, you don't lose your health insurance.

### 24. The AI Slowdown Clause
Collective bargaining agreements include a clause: AI can be introduced, but no more than X% of tasks per year can be automated. This gives workers a predictable transition timeline instead of a sudden layoff. The clause is negotiated, not imposed.

### 25. Community AI Auditors
Trained community members (not corporate consultants) who audit how AI is being used in local institutions — schools, police, hospitals, city services. They report to the public. Like community police oversight boards, but for algorithms.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

These 25 ideas share several principles that make them powerful:

1. **They're specific.** Not "redistribute wealth" but "quarterly dividends from a compute tax fund." People can picture it, argue about it, and campaign for it.

2. **They have precedents.** Every idea points to something that already works somewhere — Alaska's oil fund, Germany's Kurzarbeit, Ireland's citizen assemblies, Mexico's profit-sharing law. None require inventing something from scratch.

3. **They operate at different scales.** Some you can start next week with five neighbors (AI Guild). Some require state legislation (Compute Dividend). Some need national action (Worker Transition Corps). Everyone can find their entry point.

4. **They channel anger into structure.** The underlying message is: you're right to be angry, and here are the specific institutional mechanisms that can redirect AI's gains toward everyone.

5. **They make automation expensive or accountable, not illegal.** None of these ideas ban AI. They make sure the gains are shared and the losers are supported. That's politically viable because it doesn't require anyone to be anti-technology.

6. **They create new forms of power, not just new policies.** Data cooperatives, citizen assemblies, community wealth trusts, neighborhood guilds — these give people ongoing structural power, not just one-time benefits.
